# Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - Favorite Fonts

![screenshot](./assets/FavoriteFontsScreenshot.png)

## Overview ##

This was a 3 1/2 week long Chingu (https://chingu.io/) web development project. The goal was to create a simplified version of the Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) website. Since I went into the project having no experience with HTML, CSS or Javascript I chose the simplest of the three possible tiers (Tier 1). I spent the first 2 1/2 weeks learning HTML and CSS from this excellent Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) which I felt gave me a solid starter foundation and introduction to many best practices. I spent the final week building the site. The learning and building were done in the evenings and on weekends due to my work schedule. In this first iteration, the only Javascript functionality I was able to execute was the immediate display of any input text in the individual font cards. I did not have time to complete the Udemy course section on Javascript.

**No Frameworks, Libraries, or Code Generators Were Used - Only Vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript**

*Structure*
* Favicon
* Header - used actual Google links as placeholders *(Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)*
* Navigation bar - static except for preview text *(search, preview text, font-size, dark/light mode buttons and reset)*
* Selection of font cards with name, creator and area for the display of the preview text
* Footer section with my information
* Attribution for icon usage

*Style*
* added links in the header bar
* added icons to the navigation bar
* Preview text in each card is displayed in its corresponding font
* Text wraps in each font card if there are breaks in the entered text (e.g. sentence structure, rather than an unbroken string)
* styled the navigation bar border and font cards

*Functionality*
* Text typed into the preview text (type something) box immediately changes the preview text displayed in each font card
